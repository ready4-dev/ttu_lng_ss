## Sample and setting
<!-- Add details on sample and setting (including data collection proceedures). -->

## Measures
Data was collected on utility weights, `r get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls)` candidate predictors of utility weights and descriptive population characteristics. 

### Utility weights
Utility weights were assessed using the `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` multi-attribute utility instrument.

### Candidate predictor`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"s","")`

### Population characteristics
Population characteristic data were `r get_popl_descvs(results_ls)`.

## Statistical analysis
We implemented the generalised form of the study analysis algorithm developed by Hamilton, Gao and colleagues [@HamiltonGao2021], the key steps of which are described as follows.

### Descriptive statistics
Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise the cohort in terms of baseline population variables. Pearsonâ€™s Product Moment Correlations (*r*) were used to determine the relationships between candidate predictors and the `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` utility score.

### TTU regression models 
We compared predictive performance of a range of models predicting `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` utility scores using the candidate predictor that had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient with utility scores. The models compared include `r get_mdl_cmprsns(results_ls, describe_1L_lgl = F)`. `r get_mdl_cmprsns(results_ls)`. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to compare model fitting using training datasets and predictive ability using testing datasets using three indicators including R^2^, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)  [@RN20; @RN19].

To evaluate whether candidate predictors could independently predict utility scores, we established multivariate prediction models using baseline data with the candidate predictor and `r get_covar_ctgs(results_ls)` covariates. `r get_covars_by_ctg(results_ls, collapse_1L_lgl = T) %>% paste0(collapse = " ")`

`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"### Candidate predictor comparison","")`

### Longitudinal transfer to utility models
We next established longitudinal models using `r get_mdl_cmprsns(results_ls, describe_1L_lgl = F, mixed_1L_lgl = T)` that included both the baseline and follow-up data. Model fitting was evaluated using Bayesian R^2^ [@RN21].

### Software
We undertook all our analyses using  ***R*** `r results_ls$r_version_1L_chr` [@RCitation] using the TTU package [@TTUPackage].
