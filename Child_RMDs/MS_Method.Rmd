## Sample and setting
`r results_ls$study_descs_ls$sample_desc_1L_chr`

## Measures
Data was collected on utility weights, `r get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls)` candidate predictors of utility weights and descriptive population characteristics. 

### Utility weights
Utility weights were assessed using the `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` multi-attribute utility instrument.

### Candidate predictor`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"s","")`
`r make_cndt_predr_text(results_ls)` 

`r get_predrs_by_ctg(results_ls, long_desc_1L_lgl = T) %>% paste0(collapse=" ")`

### Population characteristics
Population characteristic data were `r get_popl_descvs(results_ls)`.

## Statistical analysis
We implemented the generalised form of the study analysis algorithm developed by Hamilton, Gao and colleagues [@HamiltonGao2021], the key steps of which are summarised as follows.

### Descriptive statistics
Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise the cohort in terms of baseline population variables. Pearson’s Product Moment Correlations (*r*) were used to determine the relationships between candidate predictors and the `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` utility score.

### TTU regression models 
We compared predictive performance of a range of models predicting `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` utility scores using the candidate predictor that had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient with utility scores. The models compared include `r get_mdl_cmprsns(results_ls, describe_1L_lgl = F)`. `r get_mdl_cmprsns(results_ls)`. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to compare model fitting with training datasets and predictive ability with testing datasets using three indicators including R^2^, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)  [@RN20; @RN19].

To evaluate whether candidate predictors could independently predict utility scores, we established multivariate prediction models using baseline data with the candidate predictor and `r get_covar_ctgs(results_ls)` covariates. `r get_covars_by_ctg(results_ls, collapse_1L_lgl = T) %>% paste0(collapse = " ")`

`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"### Candidate predictor comparison","")`
`r make_cndt_predr_text(results_ls, type = "comparison")` 

### Longitudinal transfer to utility models
We next established longitudinal models using `r get_mdl_cmprsns(results_ls, describe_1L_lgl = F, mixed_1L_lgl = T)` that included both the baseline and follow-up data. Model fitting was evaluated using Bayesian R^2^ [@RN21].

### Assessing ability of baseline measures to predict change
We assessed the potential of our evaluated predictor`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"s","")` to predict change in `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` when using only baseline measures. This goal can be accomplished by comparing longitudinal TTU model coefficients of each predictor's ${\beta}_{baseline}$ (representing between person variation) and ${\beta}_{change}$ (representing within person variation) parameters [@HamiltonGao2021]. We calculated the ${\beta}_{change}/{\beta}_{baseline}$ ratio for each evaluated single predictor longitudinal TTU model, reporting the mean ratio across all models for `r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"each","the")` predictor.

`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_scndry_analyses(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F) == 0,"","### Secondary analyses")`
`r make_scndry_anlys_text(results_ls)`

### Software
We undertook all our analyses using  ***R*** `r results_ls$r_version_1L_chr` [@RCitation] using the TTU package [@TTUPackage] (version `r results_ls$version_1L_chr`).
