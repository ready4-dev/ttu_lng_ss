### Assessing ability of baseline measures to predict change
We assessed the potential of our evaluated predictor`r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"s","")` to predict change in `r get_hlth_utl_nm(results_ls)` when using only baseline measures. This goal can be accomplished by comparing longitudinal TTU model coefficients of each predictor's ${\beta}_{baseline}$ (representing between person variation) and ${\beta}_{change}$ (representing within person variation) parameters [@HamiltonGao2021]. We calculated the ${\beta}_{change}/{\beta}_{baseline}$ ratio for each evaluated single predictor longitudinal TTU model, reporting the mean ratio across all models for `r ifelse(get_nbr_of_predrs(results_ls, as_words_1L_lgl = F)>1,"each","the")` predictor.
