## TTU regression model performance 
<!-- Table start -->The 10-fold cross-validated model fitting index from TTU models using `r get_ordered_sngl_csnl_mdls(results_ls, select_int = 1)` are reported in `r ifelse(params_ls$output_type_1L_chr=="Word","","Table")` \@ref(tab:tenfoldolstb) in the Supplementary Material<!-- Table end -->. `r make_selected_mdl_text(results_ls)` Predictive ability of each candidate predictor using baseline data were also compared using 10-fold cross-validation.  

```{r echo = F, results='asis'}

       "\\@ref(tab:tenfoldglmtb) illustrates ",
       ifelse(length(get_ordered_sngl_csnl_mdls(results_ls))>1,"that ",""),
