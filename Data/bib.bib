   abstract = {This article describes a R package Boruta, implementing a novel feature selection algorithm for finding emph\{all relevant variables\}.  The algorithm is designed as a wrapper around a random forest classification algorithm. It iteratively removes the features which are proved by a statistical test to be less relevant than random probes. The Boruta package provides a convenient interface to the algorithm. The short description of the algorithm and examples of its application are presented.},
