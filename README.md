# Longitudinal modelling manuscript authoring extension to the TTU (transfer to utility) R package
This software extends the R package TTU (https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html) by providing a toolkit for automatically authoring a first draft of a scientific manuscript from results generated by TTU functions.

The extension is intended for use and as the last component of TTU's reporting workflow for longitudinal modelling projects. Two examples of this workflow are:

- https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/articles/CSP_AQOL6D_TTU.html ; and 

- https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/articles/CSP_EQ5D_TTU.html 

In both instances, this extension is installed and deployed by a call to TTU's `write_manuscript` function. The extension adapts an existing template used to produce a manuscript for a real world study (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260129v2.full) and generalises it so the output is consistent with other studies undertaken with the TTU package. 

The extension can produce manuscripts in PDF / LaTex (examples - https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/4957407 and https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/4957805) and Word (example - https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/4957416). It should be noted that the Word output requires some manual editing to adapt section numbering, modify table headers and resize tables to page boundaries.

There are two suggested workflows to further develop the algorithm-authored first draft into something that could be submitted for publication:

If your planned submission format is PDF or LaTeX, you can edit the markdown files saved onto your machine when you first called `write_manuscript`. You can discover where in your project directory these have been saved by printing `results_ls$path_params_ls$paths_ls$path_to_ms_mkdn_1L_dir` from the results_ls object that was created by TTU's reporting workflow. Once you have completed your edits, you can then run `write_manuscript(results_ls = results_ls, output_type_1L_chr = "PDF")`. Both PDF and TeX files will be saved as a result of this command. 

If your planned submission format is Word, you can just edit the word document rendered by `write_manuscript(results_ls = results_ls, output_type_1L_chr = "Word")`.
